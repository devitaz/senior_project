# senior_project
This repository contains the driver files for testing the software I developed for my senior design project at Oregon State University, and the documentation for the project. I developed the computer vision for an autonomously driving robot. The "FindHSV.cpp" program was used to determine the HSV values typically observed on an orange traffic cone. This range of values was used in both the "HSVDetectTrafficCone.cpp" and "HaarDetectTrafficCone.cpp" programs. The reason for two driver programs for detecting the traffic cone is that I wasn't sure that I was going to get the version requiring the machine learning, Haar classifier to work so I developed another method of detecting a traffic cone which relied on only image filters. This version is far less efficient than the method utilizing machine learning, and, since I eventually got the other method to work, the "HSVDetectTrafficCone.cpp" version was never used. For more information read the documentation.
